# Agentic AI Video Analyzer 🎥🧠

An agentic AI system that intelligently analyzes uploaded videos using **PhiData's agent framework** and **Gemini-2 Flash**, delivering structured, multimodal insights with minimal user input through a simple and interactive **Streamlit web interface**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project leverages **agentic AI principles** to automate the process of video understanding. By combining **Phidata**’s agent workflows with **Gemini 2 Flash** (a multimodal large language model), it performs contextual video analysis — extracting summaries, detecting events, and generating metadata from both audio and visual streams.

## 🧩 Features

- 🔍 **Autonomous Video Analysis**  
  Upload a video and let the agent handle everything: from chunking to interpretation.

- 🧠 **Multimodal Intelligence**  
  Uses Gemini 2 Flash to understand both **frames** and **transcripts**.

- ✍️ **Summary & Metadata Generation**  
  Extracts key events, scene transitions, and meaningful segments.

- 💡 **Extensible Agent Architecture**  
  Built using the `phidata` framework, making it easy to extend with new tools and tasks.

- 🌐 **Streamlit Web UI**  
  User-friendly interface for uploading videos, running analysis, and viewing results directly in the browser.
